/**
 * Single source of truth for form-control styling.
 *
 * Every text-like control (Input, FormInput, FormTextarea, PasswordInput, SearchInput, FormSelect)
 * and the choice controls (FormCheckbox, RadioOption) build on these class strings, which resolve
 * to the `--field-*` design tokens in `styles/index.css`. To restyle or rebrand all form controls,
 * edit the tokens (or these strings) — never reach for --primary/--brand or per-page className
 * overrides that re-declare border/fill/focus.
 *
 * Surfaces: FIELD_BASE fills with the `default` surface (for controls on the page background).
 * A control inside a card should add FIELD_SURFACE_CARD, which swaps the fill so the input reads
 * against the card behind it. This is exposed as the `variant: 'default' | 'card'` prop.
 *
 * Related ADR: docs/frontend/decisions/UI.md (form-field tokens).
