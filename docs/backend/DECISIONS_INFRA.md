## Status Convention

ADRs are not deleted. If a decision is reviewed — the old ADR is marked `Superseded by ADR-XXX`, the new one — `Supersedes ADR-YYY`. This preserves the history of thought and shows how the architecture evolved.

## ADR-INFRA-001: PostgreSQL + MongoDB (polyglot persistence)

**Decision:** Core relational data in PostgreSQL, unstructured data — in MongoDB.

**Why:**
- Most data (Users, Courses, Enrollments, Payments) — strictly relational, requiring transactions and FK constraints.
- Chat sessions have a variable number of messages, do not require joins → MongoDB is a natural fit.
- Reviews: flexible schema, ability to add fields without migrations.

**What is in MongoDB:**
- `chat_sessions` — AI chat history.
- `course_reviews` — reviews with ratings.

**Alternatives:**
- Everything in PostgreSQL (JSONB for chats) — possible, but complicates query patterns for document-like data.
- Everything in MongoDB — loss of referential integrity for critical data (payments, enrollments).

## ADR-INFRA-002: Redis distributed cache — ICacheable<TValue> + MediatR pipeline behavior

**Decision:** Queries implementing `ICacheable<TValue>` are automatically cached in Redis via `CachingBehavior<TRequest, TValue>`. Commands that mutate cached data explicitly invalidate the corresponding keys after `SaveChangesAsync`.

---

### Implementation

**Interface:**
```csharp
public interface ICacheable<TValue>
{
    string CacheKey { get; }
    TimeSpan Expiration { get; }
}
```

**Pipeline behavior** implements `IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, Result<TValue>>`, where `TValue` is the second generic parameter. MediatR closes the type automatically: for `GetAllCategoriesQuery : ICacheable<IReadOnlyList<CategoryListItemDto>>` MediatR infers `TValue = IReadOnlyList<CategoryListItemDto>`. No reflection is used — `response.Value` and `Result.Ok(value)` are strongly typed at compile time.

**Serialization:** Only `Value` from `Result<T>` is cached, not the entire Result wrapper. `FluentResults.Result<T>` doesn't support JSON roundtrip (private setter on `Value`). `System.Text.Json` serializes the payload directly, deserializes it back, and the behavior wraps it in `Result.Ok(value)`.

**Invalidation:** In command handlers, after `SaveChangesAsync`, `IDistributedCache.RemoveAsync(key)` is called. `IDistributedCache` is an official Microsoft abstraction (not an infrastructure detail), so it lives in the Application layer alongside handlers.

---

### Which queries are cached and why

| Query | Key | TTL | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GetAllCategoriesQuery` | `categories:all` | 24 h | The category list changes only through admin actions. Read every time the catalog and filters are opened. Longest TTL — lowest churn. |
| `GetFeaturedCoursesQuery` | `courses:featured` | 30 m | Selection of popular courses — expensive JOIN with sorting by enrollments/rating. The query is identical for all users (public, without per-user context). |
| `GetCourseByIdQuery` | `course:{id}` | 10 m | The course details page is read heavily by students before enrolling. Includes `AverageRating` and `ReviewsCount` — modified by every review. Explicit invalidation upon course and review changes. |
| `GetPublicCoursesQuery` | `courses:public:{all 8 parameters}` | 5 m | The catalog is the most heavily loaded endpoint (search + filters + sort + pagination). Unique key for each parameter combination — impossible to pattern invalidate via `IDistributedCache` without directly depending on `IConnectionMultiplexer`. A short TTL compensates for the lack of explicit invalidation. |

**What is intentionally NOT cached:**
- Per-user queries (`GetMyProfile`, `GetMyEnrollments`, `GetMyAchievements`) — each user has their own state, frequent mutations, the key would include userId → low probability of a cache hit for a specific query.
- Admin queries — low traffic, does not impact performance.
- Real-time data (chat, SignalR notifications) — always up to date.

---

### Invalidation — where and why

**Explicit invalidation of `course:{id}` + `courses:featured`** after every course mutation:
- `PublishCourse`, `UnpublishCourse` — course status changes, it appears or disappears from the catalog.
- `ArchiveCourse`, `UnarchiveCourse` — similarly.
- `UpdateCourseDetails` — title, price, cover, category change — all are present in the cached DTO.
- `DeleteCourse`, `AdminDeleteCourse`, `AdminRecoverCourse`, `AdminUnpublishCourse` — course entirely changes state.

**Explicit invalidation of `course:{id}`** upon review mutations:
- `CreateReview`, `UpdateReview`, `DeleteReview` — all three alter `AverageRating` and `ReviewsCount` on the `Course` entity. `CourseDetailDto` includes these fields — without invalidation, the cached page would display outdated ratings.

**Explicit invalidation of `categories:all`** upon any category change:
- `CreateCategory`, `UpdateCategory`, `DeleteCategory`, `SetCategoryImage`, `DeleteCategoryImage`

**`GetPublicCoursesQuery` — TTL only (5 m):** Since the key includes all 8 filter parameters (search, skip, take, categoryId, instructorId, sortBy, isFree, minRating), there could be hundreds of different combinations. Deleting by prefix `courses:public:*` requires `IConnectionMultiplexer.GetServer().Keys()` — an expensive O(N) operation on Redis. For a catalog, a 5-minute visibility delay after course publication is acceptable.

---

### Why Redis, and not IMemoryCache

`IDistributedCache` (Redis) — the only centralized store, `RemoveAsync(key)` is a Redis `DEL` command. When horizontally scaling (multiple API instances), invalidation on one instance automatically propagates to all: the next request on any instance will yield a cache miss and re-read from the DB.

`IMemoryCache` is per-process. Invalidation on instance A does not affect instances B and C, which continue serving stale data until their TTL expires. This is unacceptable for explicitly invalidated data (category list, course detail).

**Why:**
- Popular courses, category catalog — read-heavy, rarely change.
- Redis provides O(1) lookup and TTL out of the box.
- Pipeline behavior — caching is transparent to the handler, without boilerplate in every query.
- Distributed cache works correctly during scale-out.

**Alternatives:**
- `IMemoryCache` — simpler, but yields stale data with multiple instances. Rejected for public queries.
- Lazy invalidation (TTL only for everything) — simpler, but `CourseDetailDto` with rating would show outdated numbers for minutes after a review. Rejected for `course:{id}`.
- Response caching middleware (`[ResponseCache]`) — HTTP-level cache, doesn't control per-key invalidation. Rejected.

**Consequences:**
- `ICacheable<TValue>` in `Application/Common/Caching/`
- `CachingBehavior<TRequest, TValue>` in `Application/Common/Behaviors/`
- `CacheKeys` static class in `Application/Common/Constants/`
- Redis connection string: `ConnectionStrings:Redis` in `appsettings.json`
- Packages: `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis` (Infrastructure), `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions` (Application)

## ADR-INFRA-003: Audit fields via EF SaveChanges interceptor

**Decision:** CreatedAt / UpdatedAt are automatically set via the EF SaveChanges interceptor. Properties have a private set — the interceptor sets them through the EF ChangeTracker (without reflection, EF natively supports private setters).

**Why:**
- No handler will forget to set the date.
- The logic resides in one place, not scattered across all commands.
- Private set — nobody except the interceptor can accidentally change the value.

---

## ADR-INFRA-004: DbContext natively implements IUnitOfWork

**Decision:** `ApplicationDbContext` implements `IUnitOfWork`. There is no separate `UnitOfWork` class. DI: `services.AddScoped<IUnitOfWork>(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>())` — resolves to the same scoped instance.

**Why:**
- A separate `UnitOfWork` class would merely delegate `SaveChangesAsync` to the DbContext — an unnecessary layer of indirection.
- The Application layer still only sees `IUnitOfWork`, not the DbContext — the abstraction is preserved.
- Fewer files, fewer DI registrations, fewer chances to mess up scopes.

**Alternatives:**
- A separate `UnitOfWork` class — the canonical approach, but adds a layer without functional value.

---

## ADR-INFRA-005: Outbox pattern (Schema & Background Worker)

**Decision:** The Outbox pattern is implemented to reliably execute background operations (confirm/delete blob, send email, evaluate achievements). Domain events are published in-process via `DomainEventsInterceptor` after `SaveChangesAsync`. Critical background operations are written to `OutboxMessage` within the same database transaction.

**`OutboxMessage` entity:**
- `Id`, `Type` (e.g., `DeleteBlob`, `UnlockAchievement`), `Payload` (JSONB)
- `OccurredAt`, `ProcessedAt?`, `AttemptCount`, `LastAttemptAt?`, `LastError?`, `NextRetryAt?`
- Written by the domain event handler in the same EF transaction as the entity changes.

**Outbox worker (background `IHostedService`):**
- Reads `WHERE ProcessedAt IS NULL AND (NextRetryAt IS NULL OR NextRetryAt <= NOW())`
- Invokes `IOutboxMessageDispatcher.DispatchAsync(message)` which routes to a specific handler.
- Exponential backoff via `NextRetryAt` on errors.
- **See ADR-INFRA-008:** Dispatch mechanism optimized via PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY.

---

## ADR-INFRA-006: Auto-migrations only in Development

**Decision:** `Database.MigrateAsync()` is called upon API startup via the `app.ApplyMigrationsAsync()` extension only when `app.Environment.IsDevelopment()`. In staging/prod, migrations are applied in a separate, controlled step (CI/CD or manual `dotnet ef database update`).

**Why:**
- Dev: the developer runs `docker compose up -d` and `dotnet run` — the DB is ready without additional commands. Speeds up the feedback loop.
- Prod: auto-migrations create race conditions upon scale-out (multiple instances starting simultaneously), migration error = API fails to start, destructive schema changes pass without human review.

**Alternatives:**
- Always auto-migrate — dangerous in prod (see above).
- Never auto-migrate, even in dev — every `git pull` with a new migration requires manual `dotnet ef database update`. Adds friction to daily work.
- `Database.EnsureCreatedAsync()` — incompatible with migrations, suitable only for test databases created from scratch.

**Consequences:**
- Phase D (Deploy): add a dedicated CI step to apply migrations in staging/prod, or generate an idempotent SQL script via `dotnet ef migrations script --idempotent` and apply it using a migration tool (Flyway/custom).
- Developers should expect migrations to run automatically upon their first `dotnet run` after a `git pull` — they will see this in the console via `LogInformation`.

---

## ADR-INFRA-007: Background job scheduling — IHostedService vs Quartz.NET vs Hangfire

**Decision:** For background tasks, we use `BackgroundService` + `PeriodicTimer` (built into .NET). We will not introduce Quartz.NET or Hangfire until there is a specific need for their capabilities.

**Why IHostedService is sufficient for now:**
- All current background tasks are idempotent and safe to run on every replica (reconciliation, cleanup, seeding). Parallel execution on multiple instances does not lead to incorrect results.
- Zero additional dependencies — `BackgroundService` is part of `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`.
- The pattern is already utilized in the codebase (RefreshTokenCleanup, OutboxProcessor, etc.) — consistency outweighs premature flexibility.

**What Quartz.NET and Hangfire can do (and IHostedService cannot):**

| Capability | IHostedService | Quartz.NET | Hangfire |
|---|---|---|---|
| Distributed lock (singleton execution across replicas) | ❌ | ✅ (DB/Redis) | ✅ (DB) |
| Cron-expressions for scheduling | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Management UI | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (built-in) |
| Job persistence (retry after crash) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Fire-and-forget from web request | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Dependency footprint | 0 | Quartz + extensions | Hangfire.Core + storage |

**Key concept — Distributed Lock:**
If the API runs on 3 servers simultaneously (horizontal scaling), `IHostedService` will start the job on ALL 3 servers in parallel. Quartz.NET and Hangfire solve this via a distributed lock in a shared DB or Redis: only ONE instance executes the job, others wait or skip the tick. This is critical for tasks with side-effects (sending email, charging payments) — duplication is unacceptable.

**When to switch to Quartz.NET or Hangfire:**
- A job emerges that MUST run exactly once across all replicas (e.g., sending a monthly digest).
- A dashboard is required to monitor and manually retrigger jobs.
- The number of background jobs grows > ~5–6 and managing them via `AddHostedService` becomes cumbersome.
- Complex cron schedules are required (first Monday of the month, every workday at 9:00, etc.).

**Consequences of the current decision:**
- `CategoryCoursesCountReconciliationService`, `RefreshTokenCleanupHostedService`, and others run on every replica in parallel — this is acceptable because they are all idempotent.
- Upon introducing horizontal scaling (Phase Deploy) — audit all `IHostedService` instances to ensure they remain safe to run in parallel.
- Background tasks (emails, achievements) transitioned to the Outbox processor which correctly handles concurrency via database locks.

## ADR-INFRA-008: Outbox latency — PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY instead of polling-only

> Partially supersedes ADR-INFRA-005 regarding the "Outbox worker (background IHostedService)" — the message dispatch mechanism was changed from pure polling to push-first with a polling fallback.

**Context and problem:**

The initial Outbox implementation (ADR-INFRA-005) utilized pure polling: `OutboxProcessorService` with a `PeriodicTimer(10s)` executed a SELECT on the `OutboxMessages` table on every tick. This worked well for blob operations and emails, where a 10s latency was acceptable.

The issue became critical with the introduction of chained events in the achievement system (ADR-ACHIEVEMENT-001, ADR-ACHIEVEMENT-007):

```text
LessonCompleted → SaveChanges
    → DomainEventsInterceptor → outbox: EvaluateLessonCompleted
    → ⏳ up to 10s (polling)
    → AchievementEvaluator → UserAchievement.Unlock() → SaveChanges
        → DomainEventsInterceptor → outbox: NotifyAchievementUnlocked
        → ⏳ up to 10s more (polling)
        → SignalR push → toast in browser
```

Two polling cycles = **up to 20 seconds** from lesson completion to achievement notification. This is unacceptable for UX.

---

**Decision:** `OutboxProcessorService` now wakes up immediately following an INSERT into `OutboxMessages` utilizing PostgreSQL's native `LISTEN/NOTIFY` mechanism. The 10s interval polling remains as a fallback.

**How PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY works:**

PostgreSQL features a built-in lightweight pub/sub mechanism, distinct from replication and WAL. It operates at the session (connection) level:

1. **NOTIFY** — any transaction can execute `pg_notify('channel_name', 'optional_payload')`. The message is buffered and sent **only after COMMIT** of the transaction. If the transaction rolls back — the notification is not sent. This provides a key guarantee: the processor only receives a signal regarding committed data.

2. **LISTEN** — the client (`NpgsqlConnection`) registers on the channel. Thereafter, any `NOTIFY` on this channel from any connection is delivered as an event to all LISTEN-subscribers. PostgreSQL guarantees delivery to all active subscribers at the moment of COMMIT.

3. **Limitations:** If a subscriber is disconnected at the moment of NOTIFY — the message is lost. LISTEN/NOTIFY lacks persistence (unlike a message broker). That is precisely why polling remains as a fallback: even if the listener was disconnected, the processor will pick up the message on the next 10-second tick.

**Implementation Architecture (3 components):**

**1. PostgreSQL trigger (database layer):**

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION notify_outbox_insert() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM pg_notify('outbox_new', '');
  RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_outbox_notify
  AFTER INSERT ON "OutboxMessages"
  FOR EACH STATEMENT EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_outbox_insert();
```

`FOR EACH STATEMENT` (not `FOR EACH ROW`) — if a single `SaveChanges` writes 5 outbox messages, the trigger fires once. The payload is empty — only the fact "there are new messages" is required; specific IDs are unnecessary because the processor executes its own filtered SELECT.

**2. `OutboxNotificationListener` (Infrastructure BackgroundService):**

A dedicated long-lived `NpgsqlConnection` (not pooled!) listens to the `outbox_new` channel:

```csharp
await using var connection = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString);
await connection.OpenAsync(ct);
await using var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("LISTEN outbox_new", connection);
await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(ct);

while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
    await connection.WaitAsync(ct);  // blocks until notification arrives
```

Why a dedicated connection: PostgreSQL's LISTEN state is bound to a specific session. Connection pooling (`NpgsqlDataSource`) returns the connection to the pool after use — losing the LISTEN state. Thus, the listener opens a distinct connection that persists throughout the application lifetime.

Upon connection drop — automatic reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s cap) occurs. During reconnects, the polling fallback ensures delivery.

**3. `OutboxSignal` (in-process bridge):**

A `SemaphoreSlim` singleton that bridges the listener and the processor. The listener invokes `signal.Notify()` upon receiving a PG notification. The processor awaits `signal.WaitAsync(10s, ct)` — returning immediately upon a signal or after 10s (fallback).

Additionally: the processor signals itself (`signal.Notify()`) if it processed **at least one message** (`messages.Count > 0`). This guarantees instantaneous processing of cascading events (e.g., when processing one message generates another — `NotifyAchievementUnlocked`), without awaiting a new DB signal or the 10s timeout.

**Results:**

| Scenario | Polling-only | LISTEN/NOTIFY + fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Single-hop (email, blob) | up to 10s | < 100ms |
| Achievement chain (2 hops) | up to 20s | < 500ms |
| Idle load (no messages) | SELECT every 10s | SELECT every 10s |
| New dependencies | — | 0 (Npgsql is already present) |

---

**Alternatives considered:**

1. **Reduce polling interval to 1s** — simplest, but 1 SELECT/s on an empty table = unnecessary load. During scale-out (N instances) this equals N SELECT/s. Does not scale well.

2. **In-process SemaphoreSlim without PostgreSQL** — signaling from `DomainEventsInterceptor` directly. Works for single-instance, but during horizontal scaling, instance A writes an outbox message, and instance B (running the processor) receives no signal. PG LISTEN/NOTIFY operates cross-connection and cross-process.

3. **Debezium CDC (Change Data Capture)** — Production-grade for microservices. Rejected: requires Kafka + Debezium + Kafka consumers — disproportionate for a monolith.

4. **Wolverine framework** — .NET framework with built-in LISTEN/NOTIFY outbox. Rejected: Wolverine replaces MediatR and employs its own pipeline — migrating the entire architecture.

5. **CAP library** — lightweight event bus with a built-in outbox. Rejected: introduces custom abstractions (`ICapPublisher`), conflicting with the existing outbox implementation.

6. **Hybrid: optimistic dispatch + outbox as safety net** (NServiceBus approach) — Rejected for the current architecture: requires changes in the Application layer (the handler must be aware of dispatch), violating layer separation.

---

**Consequences:**

- Migration `AddOutboxNotifyTrigger` creates the PL/pgSQL function and trigger.
- `OutboxNotificationListener` in `Infrastructure/Services/` — as a distinct `BackgroundService`.
- `OutboxSignal` in `Infrastructure/Outbox/` — singleton `SemaphoreSlim` wrapper.
- `OutboxProcessorService` modified: `PeriodicTimer` → `outboxSignal.WaitAsync(10s)`.
- One additional PostgreSQL connection (unpooled) for LISTEN — minimal resource footprint.

**Scale-out safety (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`):**

The Outbox processor utilizes `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` instead of a regular SELECT:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "OutboxMessages"
WHERE "ProcessedAt" IS NULL AND "NextRetryAt" <= {now}
ORDER BY "OccurredAt"
LIMIT {batch_size}
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

- `FOR UPDATE` — locks the selected rows at the PostgreSQL transaction level. Other transactions cannot `SELECT FOR UPDATE` them until COMMIT.
- `SKIP LOCKED` — if a row is already locked by another instance, skip it instead of waiting.
- **Timestamp rounding buffer:** `{now}` is calculated as `DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(1)` to circumvent PostgreSQL microsecond rounding issues.
- Result: Instance A grabs messages 1–10, Instance B grabs 11–20. No duplication.

The entire batch is wrapped in an explicit transaction (`BeginTransactionAsync` → `CommitAsync`) to maintain the lock while processing.

---

## ADR-INFRA-009: Embedded Resources for Data Seeding

**Decision:** Assets (images and videos) required for database seeding (courses, lessons, avatars) are stored directly within the `Learnix.Infrastructure` assembly as Embedded Resources, rather than in the file system or as Base64 strings in the code. Upon upload to Blob Storage, each generated entity (course or video lesson) receives its own unique copy of the file (a unique `blobPath` is generated).

**Why:**
- **Environment independence:** Seeder code does not depend on the host file system or current working directory (which is problematic in Docker or during tests).
- **Code size:** The previous approach utilized large Base64 strings directly in C# code, polluting it and complicating reading.
- **Data isolation:** During seeding, every course or lesson receives its own unique path in Blob Storage. This prevents conflicts (e.g., accidental deletion of a shared `placeholder.mp4` via the admin panel).

**Alternatives:**
- **Base64 constants in code (old decision):** Pollutes C# files, difficult to maintain large files. Rejected.
- **Reading from the file system (`File.ReadAllBytes`):** Requires proper `Copy to Output Directory` setup, paths may break.
- **Shared Blob Storage object:** Uploading one `placeholder.mp4` and linking it from all lessons. Rejected: deleting a video in one lesson would trigger Outbox `DeleteBlob`, destroying the shared file and causing 404s in others.

**Consequences:**
- Files added to the `Learnix.Infrastructure/Assets/` folder and configured as `<EmbeddedResource>` in `Learnix.Infrastructure.csproj`.
- `CourseSeederHostedService` and `StudentSeederHostedService` utilize `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream()`.
- Each uploaded copy receives a `Guid.NewGuid()` in its path (`blobPath`), ensuring uniqueness and safe deletion.

## ADR-INFRA-010: PII Masking in Application Logs

**Context:**
During a security audit, it was discovered that the email sending service (`SmtpEmailSender`) logged complete user email addresses at the `Information` level (e.g., `logger.LogInformation("Email sent to Oleh123@gmail.com")`). In a production environment, these logs might be transmitted to centralized systems (ELK, Datadog), accessible to a broad array of developers. Logging Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in plaintext creates security risks and violates compliance (GDPR).

**Decision:**
Implement a PII masking rule across all application logs.
For email addresses, employ partial character obfuscation instead of complete redaction or hashing, as partial obfuscation (e.g., `O***@gmail.com`) retains sufficient context for debugging without exposing the full address.
Any service logging sensitive data (email, phones, IP addresses) must apply masking functions prior to writing to `ILogger`.

**Consequences:**
- Security: Reduces the risk of PII leaks via log aggregation systems.
- Debugging: While full masking complicates debugging, the compromise approach (displaying the first letter and domain) aids troubleshooting.
- Additional effort: Developers must remain vigilant regarding the data they log.


## ADR-INFRA-011: Repository Pattern via Ardalis.Specification

**Decision:** Specific repository interfaces per aggregate root extending IRepositoryBase<T> from Ardalis.Specification. No custom repository base classes.

**Structure:**
- **Interface (Application layer):** public interface ICourseRepository : IRepositoryBase<Course>
- **Implementation (Infrastructure layer):** internal sealed class CourseRepository : RepositoryBase<Course>, ICourseRepository

**Why:**
- RepositoryBase<T> from Ardalis already provides FirstOrDefaultAsync, ListAsync, CountAsync, AddAsync, UpdateAsync, DeleteAsync accepting specifications.
- Prevents boilerplate repository implementations.
- Keeps Application layer decoupled from Entity Framework while still allowing complex queries via Specifications.

---

## ADR-INFRA-012: Application Settings via IOptions<T>

**Decision:** Configuration sections from ppsettings.json are strongly typed to POCOs and consumed via IOptions<T>.

**Conventions:**
- POCOs reside in Application/Common/Settings/ (e.g., JwtSettings.cs). The Application layer knows configuration types, but not IConfiguration directly.
- Registration occurs only in Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs via services.Configure<T>(...).
- Connection strings remain separate (ConnectionStrings:Postgres, ConnectionStrings:AzureBlobStorage).

**Why:**
- Strongly typed settings prevent magic string errors.
- Dependency rule: Application layer doesn't depend on Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration abstractions, only on its own models.
