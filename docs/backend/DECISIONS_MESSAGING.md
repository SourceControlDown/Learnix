# Learnix — ADR: Student ↔ Instructor Messaging

> Covers F-26 (chat UI), F-28 (notification bell), and the backend endpoints/hub.

## ADR-MSG-001: PostgreSQL over MongoDB for Course Conversations

**Decision:** `CourseConversation` and `CourseMessage` are EF Core entities stored in PostgreSQL, not MongoDB documents.

**Why:**
- Conversations have hard FK relationships to `Course`, `User` (student), and `User` (instructor) — all already in PostgreSQL. Storing the data in MongoDB would require cross-database fetches every time the conversation list is rendered.
- A unique constraint `(CourseId, StudentId)` enforces exactly one thread per student per course at the DB level — trivial in PostgreSQL, awkward to enforce in MongoDB.
- Pagination of messages is a simple `ORDER BY CreatedAt OFFSET/LIMIT` query — no document size concerns.
- The EF Core + Ardalis Specification pattern used everywhere else in the codebase applies without any adaption.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- MongoDB — used for AI chat sessions because those are user-scoped documents with no FK joins. Student-instructor chat is inherently relational; using MongoDB would trade one schema migration for permanent cross-database query impedance.

## ADR-MSG-002: Separate `ChatHub` from `AchievementsHub`

> **Superseded by ADR-MSG-007.** Original decision kept for history.

**Decision:** A dedicated `ChatHub : Hub<IChatHubClient>` at `/hubs/chat` handles messaging events. It is separate from `AchievementsHub`.

**Why:**
- Clean separation of concerns: achievements push is a one-way notification (server → client only). Chat push is also server → client, but carries different payload types and has different lifecycle requirements.
- Separate hubs are independently deployable and scale independently under Azure SignalR Service.
- Avoids a growing "God hub" with mixed notification types.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- Unified `NotificationsHub` handling both achievements and messages — simpler at first, but merges unrelated domains and complicates client-side handler routing.

## ADR-MSG-003: REST for History + SignalR for Real-Time Delivery

**Decision:** Message history is fetched via REST (`GET /api/messages/conversations/{id}/messages`) and cached by TanStack Query. New messages arrive in real-time via SignalR `ReceiveMessage` push, which triggers a React Query cache invalidation.

**Why:**
- REST history is cacheable and paginatable — TanStack Query handles stale-while-revalidate, refetch-on-window-focus, and `skip/take` pagination naturally.
- SignalR delivery is ephemeral — perfect for "new message arrived" events that should not be stored client-side.
- Separating concerns keeps the SignalR payload minimal (just the new message DTO) rather than having the hub stream full conversation history.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- SignalR-only — hub sends full history on connect. Loses React Query caching and makes offline/reconnect handling complex.
- Polling only — adds 30-second latency for message delivery, poor UX for a chat feature.

## ADR-MSG-004: 1-on-1 Conversation per Student per Course

**Decision:** Each enrolled student gets exactly one private thread with the instructor, scoped to the course. Enforced via `UNIQUE(CourseId, StudentId)` index.

**Why:**
- Private threads match the tutoring/support mental model — students ask questions privately.
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate threads via race conditions.
- `GetOrStartConversation` query creates the thread on first student interaction with a safe get-or-create pattern.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- Group Q&A per course — all students see each other's questions. More appropriate for a forum feature (separate scope), not for private support.

## ADR-MSG-005: Unread Count via Denormalized Fields on Conversation

**Decision:** `CourseConversation` has `StudentUnreadCount` and `InstructorUnreadCount` integer fields. These are incremented by `AddMessage()` and reset to 0 by `MarkReadByStudent()` / `MarkReadByInstructor()`.

**Why:**
- Getting the total unread count for the notification bell requires only `SUM(InstructorUnreadCount) WHERE InstructorId = userId` — one indexed aggregation query, no message table scan.
- Increments and resets happen atomically in the same `SaveChangesAsync` call as the conversation update — no separate "read receipt" table needed.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- Per-message `IsRead` flag — requires a `COUNT(messages WHERE IsRead = false AND recipientId = userId)` scan across the entire messages table. Expensive as message volume grows.
- Separate `UnreadCount` table — adds a third table and complicates the transaction boundary.

## ADR-MSG-006: `IChatNotifier` Abstraction for SignalR Push

**Decision:** `IChatNotifier` lives in the Application layer with two methods: `NotifyNewMessageAsync` (pushes `ReceiveMessage` to the recipient's SignalR group) and `NotifyUnreadCountChangedAsync` (pushes `UnreadCountChanged` to the affected user). `SignalRChatNotifier` implements it in Infrastructure.

**Why:**
- Same pattern as `IAchievementNotifier` / `SignalRAchievementNotifier` — consistent with the codebase.
- Application layer handlers call `IChatNotifier` directly after `SaveChangesAsync()` — no domain event needed because the handler already has all context (who sent, who receives, updated counts).
- Testable: handlers can be unit-tested by mocking `IChatNotifier`.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- Domain events for messaging — meaningful for achievements because detection is complex (many conditions evaluated asynchronously). For messaging, the handler already knows the recipient and unread count immediately — domain event overhead adds no value.

## ADR-MSG-007: Unified `NotificationsHub` (supersedes ADR-MSG-002)

**Decision:** `ChatHub` and `AchievementsHub` are merged into a single `NotificationsHub : Hub<INotificationsHubClient>` at `/hubs/notifications`. The frontend opens one WebSocket connection for all real-time events.

**Why:**
- Two hubs = two WebSocket connections per authenticated user for no architectural gain. Both hubs used the same auth, the same `user-{userId}` group pattern, and the same `[Authorize]` attribute — there was nothing functionally separate about them.
- As the notification surface grows (certificate ready, in-app notifications — B-41/B-42), each new domain would require a third, fourth hub. One hub scales horizontally via Azure SignalR Service just as well as two.
- `INotificationsHubClient` defines all four typed methods: `ReceiveMessage`, `UnreadCountChanged`, `AchievementUnlocked`, `CertificateReady`. Client-side handler routing is a simple `connection.on('EventName', handler)` — there is no routing complexity.
- The frontend `useNotificationsHub` hook replaces `useChatHub` + `useAchievementsHub`, reducing layout component coupling.

**Rejected alternative that was previously chosen (ADR-MSG-002):**
- Separate hubs per domain — driven by "independent deployability" concern that does not apply at this scale (single API process, single Azure Container App). The scale argument becomes relevant only when consumers are extracted to separate services.
