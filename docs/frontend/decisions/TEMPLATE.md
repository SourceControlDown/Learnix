# Learnix — Frontend Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Guidelines

This document outlines the conventions and templates for writing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) within the Learnix frontend.

## ADR Numbering Convention

**Decision:** Each decision document uses its own `ADR-FRONT-<SCOPE>-NNN` prefix where `SCOPE` is the file's topic (e.g., `ARCH`, `API`, `UI`, `AUTH`). Numbers restart at `001` per file. All decision documents are written in **English** (or Ukrainian, depending on the established historical baseline for a specific file, though English is preferred for broad technical context).

Examples:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `ADR-FRONT-ARCH-001`, `ADR-FRONT-ARCH-002`, …
- `API.md` → `ADR-FRONT-API-001`, `ADR-FRONT-API-002`, …
- `UI.md` → `ADR-FRONT-UI-001`, `ADR-FRONT-UI-002`, …

**Why:**
- A single global sequence works only as long as there is one file. Once decisions are split into topic files, the sequence becomes meaningless.
- File-scoped numbering lets each topic file be self-contained.
- The `FRONT` prefix prevents numbering conflicts with backend ADRs.

## Template for New Records (ADR Template)

```markdown
## ADR-FRONT-XXX: [Decision Title]

**Decision:** [What exactly was decided]

**Why:** [Justification]

**Alternatives:** [What was considered and why it was rejected]

**Consequences:** [What this changes in the code / architecture]
```
